## Title
Existence and Stability of Static Dark Fluid Thin Shells in Schwarzschild–de Sitter Spacetimes and Consequences for Black Hole Shadows


## Abstract
We analyze the existence and stability of static, spherically symmetric thin shells separating two Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetimes characterized by  mass parameters \(m_{\pm}\) and cosmological constants \(\Lambda_{\pm}\).  Using the Israel junction formalism and a linear barotropic equation of state, \(p = \lambda (\sigma - \sigma_1)c^2\) (where $\sigma_1$ constant), we derive the effective potential that determines the shell's stability against radial perturbations. A systematic stability analysis maps out the parameter space spanned by \(\lambda\), the equilibrium equation-of-state parameter \(w_0\), and the ratios \(m_{+}/m_{-}\) and \(\Lambda_{+}/\Lambda_{-}\). For a physically motivated example of a supermassive black hole and a cosmological constant of the order set by the Planck measurements\cite{Planck2018}, stable static configurations (with positive surface energy density and \(0<\lambda\leq 1\)) exist only when \(m_{+}/m_{-} > 1\). These configurations occur primarily at three distinct characteristic scales: near the black hole photon sphere, around the Schwarzschild--de Sitter static radius \(R_{\mathrm{st}}\), and in the vicinity of the cosmological horizon.   The presence of a positive cosmological constant permits stable shells with negative pressure (\(w_0 < 0\)), a feature absent in the pure Schwarzschild matching. Several mechanisms, including cosmological Hubble expansion, can perturb static thin shells from equilibrium. At scales $\gtrsim (3 Gm/c^2\Lambda)^{1/3}$, expansion quasi-statically may shift shells from their minima. Investigating the dynamics of stable shells with perturbed initial conditions provides a physical time scale for the oscillation period. Finally, we show that such a shell acts as a refractive gravitational layer—magnifying the black hole shadow's angular size mainly for a static external observer—with an imprint that depends explicitly on the equation-of-state parameter, suggesting future observations could probe the existence and physical properties of dark fluid configurations.
